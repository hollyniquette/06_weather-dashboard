## Description

This application is a dashboard for users to view the weather outlook for any city they wish to search for. When users search for a city, they will be able to view a 5-day forecast including the temperature, humidity, and wind speed, while also saving that city to their search history. Users can then refer back to any city they've previously searched and get the updated weather conditions.

## Installation and Usage

Visit the deployed application to check the weather outlook for any city [here]().
